# Backend Goals

1. **Migrate to New Database**: Switch from `safuneral` database to `safs-product-catalog` on the new MongoDB Atlas cluster.
2. **Serverless Architecture**: Continue using Vercel Serverless Functions for a cost-effective, scalable, and easy-to-maintain backend.
3. **Secure API**: Ensure all write operations are protected by authentication (Admin only).
4. **Unified Data Source**: Serve all product data from MongoDB, removing reliance on static JSON files.
